Elasic block storage allows u to create storage volumes and attch them to Amazon EC2 instances. Once  attached, you can create a file system on top of these volumes, run a DB, or use them in any other way you would use a block device
Amazon EBS volumes are places in a specific AZ where they are autommatically replicated to protect you from the failure of a single component.

EBS Volumes:

General Purpose SSD (GP2)
  General Purpose, balances both price and performance
  Ratio of 3 IOPS per GB with up to 10,000 IOPS and the ability to burst up to 3000 IOPS for extended periods of time for volumes at 3334GB and above

Provisioned IOPS SSD (IO1)
  Anaother SSD drive for hugh performace applications like related DB applications etc. More then 10,000 IOPS
  you can provision more than 20000 IOPS

Throughput Optimized HHD (ST1)
  Big Data
  warehouses
  Log processing
  Cannot be a boot volume

Cold HDD (SC1)
  Lowest cost storage for infrequently accessed workloads
  File Server
  Cannot be a  boot volume

Magnetic (Standard)
